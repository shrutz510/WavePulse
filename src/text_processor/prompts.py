And my question is, the candidates have to qualify for the ballot on all the states, and they have to qualify for the debates that's coming up.So my question is, what rules or regulations do they have to replace a candidate two-thirds into the presidential race? There really are no rules at some point.I mean, at that point, once you get to a certain point, it won't be the voters that decide.It will be the Democratic National Committee.And that is the radical establishment that is the Democratic National Committee.And at that point, all bets would be off. You know, Van Jones, I think, has raised the bar very, very high for Joe Biden in as much as him saying that if he doesn't have a good debate, it's over.And I think that's his way of saying that to the Biden people, you better get your act together and he better show up and we better get a good performance out of him or else he's going to be gone. I think you've been hearing very loudly from him and Axelrod and James Carville.I don't think it's any accident that those people are so public in their criticism of Joe Biden because I think they want him off the ticket.So, you know, time will tell.We'll see.If I had to guess, Kamala Harris would be first in line behind her.

From your news and information leader, KBIZ, I'm Connor Davis.Governor Kim Reynolds says the Arizona law the U.S.Supreme Court ruled was unconstitutional back in 2012 is different from Iowa's immigration law.And that's why she's optimistic a higher court will allow it to go into effect.We are basically enforcing the United States immigration laws that are on the books. Reynolds says.Reynolds says Arizona tried to create new regulations, like making it a state crime if immigrants stopped by Arizona law enforcement did not have a government-issued ID or immigration papers.They had actually superseded the existing U.S.immigration laws that are on the books, but Iowa didn't in their law that we passed. Early this week, a federal judge ruled that the federal government has sole authority to enforce immigration law, and he issued a temporary injunction blocking the state law from taking effect July 1st.Iowa's law would let police charge immigrants with a state crime if they've been deported or were denied entry into the country.Reynolds says states have to act. It's horrible when we have a president of the United States that's not doing his constitutional duty to protect the United States citizens and most importantly the sovereignty of this country.And so if I have a president that won't do his duty, then you bet the states and the governors are going to step up.Civil rights groups that are suing say the Iowa law is unconstitutional and could lead to deporting Iowans who've been granted asylum or legal residency after they were previously deported. In other news, there's still no drought in Iowa, but the number of counties where the soil is considered abnormally dry has almost doubled in the past week, bouncing from around 16 counties to nearly 31, according to the latest U.S.Drought Monitor map.Angie Reek-Hines, a field agronomist with the Iowa State University Extension, says crop conditions in her region of north central Iowa are improving.Last week the corn finally greened up and took off in growth.This week's The beans are finally greening up and looking like they're getting some rapid growth.It requires a delicate balance of both rain and sunshine to grow crops, and this season's been heavy on the rain so far, as a change of pace from nearly four years of drought.Reek Hines says the gusty winds are also an issue.It's really hard to get those post-supplied herbicides on because it's just so windy, and we want those herbicides to land in our field and not our neighbor's field.We don't want a drift situation. So it would remind people to make sure they're looking at the labels, make sure they're not off-label with their herbicide applications.Iowa's backyard gardeners know how tough it is to keep out the weeds.So imagine what it's like for farmers with a few hundred acres of crops.She says weeds are sprouting in many fields left and right.That has been a huge challenge this year because we were so wet early on.We just couldn't get a lot of timely herbicide applications.Farmers might want to think about that second post-application in soybeans. just to get those weeds under control, especially if they didn't have a pre-emerge herbicide on and those weeds got ahead of them.Forecasters say temperatures will rise back into the 80s and 90s today and for the next several days across much of Iowa, with the chance for scattered showers through Saturday. In other news, FEMA has set the details for its third Agriculture Recovery Center Day.Radio Iowa's Dar Danielson reports.The event will be on the Des Moines Area Community College campus in Ankeny on Friday, June 28th from noon to 8 p.m.The Ag Recovery Center brings state, federal, and local agencies together with farming industry groups to provide information... on ag or rural needs that are not covered by standard disaster programs offered by FEMA and the state.FEMA advises you to come to the event, even if you're not sure if your items are covered, as experts can make that determination.Ready to go, Iowa.I'm Doug Danielson. In other news, at least four Iowa mayors are attending the U.S.Conference of Mayors underway in Kansas City through Sunday.The nonpartisan gathering of 200-plus mayors is open to those from communities with populations of 30,000 or more.Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart says homelessness is one challenging issue many of the elected leaders from across the country are facing.Mayor Hart says he launched a homelessness task force earlier this month.We're going to take a look at the data collection to figure out who's homeless, which demographic meets that and then just work collectively on best practices, not just in the local area, but also networking and talking to other mayors and stealing some of those best practices.Gun violence is another key topic.Though Hart says Waterloo's numbers in that category are trending downward, which he credits to efforts like gun buyback programs.Many communities are also struggling with mental health, Hart says, and how to expand services."""

Hi, Sean.Thanks for helping save democracy by reporting things that the other networks don't.Oh, I'm trying.By the way, how cool is it for the service industry out in Vegas?And I spent 10 years in the restaurant business.How cool is it that Donald Trump said, you know what, can we stop taxing tips that hardworking Americans get for great service? I mean, can we stop doing that?Because the government has been going after that with a vengeance since the years that I worked at restaurants.And it's like that's how they make their living.People don't know oftentimes that if you work in an industry, like if you're a waiter or a waitress or a bartender, you don't even get paid the minimum wage because they assume you get the tips. And and then the government wants a full accounting of every night you work and how much money you make in tips.And then if they don't think your estimate is high enough, they're going to estimate higher.And then you have to fight the IRS.I know because I know people that have been through this process.It's unbelievable.I've got to imagine service workers, you know, that historically have been pressured by their unions to vote Democratic in your state are going to be pretty open to Donald Trump's idea. Well, actually, my wife works for a hotel.She's in housekeeping, so her tips are in cash.But most of her friends, you know, like the bartenders and the casino workers, you know, if they're a waitress, you know, their tips are on the credit card.So they're the ones that are really getting hurt.By the way, people, I've always found that housekeepers and hotels... are like the nicest people and the hardest working people and the most humble people.And a long time ago, I just got in the habit when I'm leaving a hotel for the day, you know, I always have cash on me.I'll take out a 20 and I put it on the pillow.And it's just my way of saying thank you and I appreciate all the hard work you do.I mean, do a lot of people tip your wife like that or at least something? Well, actually, she gets a lot of gifts.Where she works, there's a lot of people from Hawaii, and she gets a lot of Hawaiian candy that they leave for her.Isn't that really nice when people just, you know, appreciate, you know, the hard work that goes into keeping a room clean?By the way, in my case, it's a little especially hard because I'm not the cleanest person on earth.Well, I have a question I want to ask you about the upcoming presidential debate. Yeah, I agree with you that Joe Biden is going to be jacked up and, you know, maybe they should do drug testing.But in 2016, Anderson Cooper of CNN was one of the moderators on the second debate.And then later, Donna Brazile admitted giving Hillary Clinton the debate questions in advance.Now, can you on your TV show challenge Trump? fake tapper to sign a sworn statement that CNN will not provide debate questions to the White House, because it wouldn't surprise me at all if CNN is going to give the White House the questions in advance. You've got to understand the back story here because the back story is that they have basically taken all of Joe Biden's guidance and they've given the Trump team next to no room to negotiate.Donald Trump's team had no say in who to pick as the moderator. Joe Biden picked the four networks and the only four networks that he would agree to go on.I think he probably there were conversations with CNN, I would suspect, long before the announcement. And so the whole thing has been stacked against Donald Trump from the beginning.I think the fake Jake Tapper, we have chronicled him often on this program, doesn't like Donald Trump.And I'm going to go over this in great specificity and detail tonight on Hannity on the Vox News channel.Same with Dana Bash.They have a format that I think just favors just favors Joe Biden.I mean, they have this silly two one one format. you know, 2-1-1 format, two minutes to answer a question, one minute to respond, one minute to respond.Moderators have the discretion what they want to do with the next one minute of that block.You know, the worst part of it is the debate question is going to be a truncated version that they'll put on the screen.Donald Trump commits insurrection.Donald Trump's reaction to insurrection. Donald Trump's call for retribution.It's going to be corrupt and abusively biased, but it's going to be three on one.And, you know, there's no guarantee that there's going to be I would say half this debate is going to be about. Donald Trump, January 6th, retribution, insurrection, election denial.I mean, they're not going to bring up all the other election deniers in 2000 and 2004.I'll scroll these names tonight on Hannity on the Fox News channel.A lot of Democrats support, you know, a lot of election deniers in the Democratic Party. And and they all get a pass, starting with Hillary Clinton, you know, claiming the election was stolen from her and that he's an illegitimate president.All of these things took place.And, you know, I just you just got to see for see this for what it is and understand it.But Trump's doing it anyway."""
